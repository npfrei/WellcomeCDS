In mythology, she sought her dead husband and brother, Osiris, and conceived her son, Horus, by him. She protected her son from snakes, predators and other dangers and was also believed to protect mortal children. Ancient Egyptian mothers breast-fed their babies, probably into the subsequent pregnancy. Wealthy women employed wet nurses. Prescriptions for galactogogues (substances which increase the flow of milk) may be found in the Ebers papyrus (Eb 836, 837) which is dated c 1555 BCE.\nThis wall relief is from the temple at Edfu in Southern Upper Egypt which is the most completely preserved in Egypt. It dates from the Ptolemaic period (332-180 BCE) although the western side has an inner and outer enclosure which was built during the Old Kingdom (2613-2181 BCE).\nPhotograph taken in 1989."

In mythology, she sought her dead husband and brother, Osiris, and conceived her son, Horus, by him. She protected her son from snakes, predators and other dangers and was also believed to protect mortal children. Ancient Egyptian mothers breast-fed their babies, probably into the subsequent pregnancy. Wealthy women employed wet nurses. Prescriptions for galactogogues (substances which increase the flow of milk) may be found in the Ebers papyrus (Eb 836, 837) which is dated c 1555 BCE.\nThis wall relief is from the temple at Edfu in Southern Upper Egypt which is the most completely preserved in Egypt. It dates from the Ptolemaic period (332-180 BCE) although the western side has an inner and outer enclosure which was built during the Old Kingdom (2613-2181 BCE).\nPhotograph taken in 1989."
